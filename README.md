# Image-Forgery
Complete paper and code list for image forgery(and deepfake).没有代码的文章就是流氓，收集能运行，可学习的paper。
# :pencil:Overview
Some papers may not be from top conferences, and might even come from SCI Q3 or Q4 journals, but they have open-sourced their code, ensuring the authenticity of their work. Although the methods might seem insignificant in a very niche field, they can provide us with many valuable insights.
